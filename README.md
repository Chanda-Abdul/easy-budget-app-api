## Summary

Easy budget is an interactive web application that was created to view and manage your monthly budget.  This app was created so that you can view all of your monthly expenses and figure out whether they align with your financial goals.

# 
# Easy Budget API
Easy Budget's back-end consists of an API server that was created with Node.js, Express, Knex, and PostgreSQL
 
Easy Budget's API service consists of `/GET` `/DELETE` `/POST` and `/PATCH` endpoints

The API was created locally and deployed to heroku.  The API can be accessed through heroku [here](https://fast-garden-40399.herokuapp.com/).

### /GET at `/expenses`
The user can access the `/GET` endpoint through the client by visiting the `/budget` page and all expenses will be displayed.  The `/GET` endpoint can also be accessed at `/expenses` on the back-end through the heroku server at [https://fast-garden-40399.herokuapp.com/expenses](https://fast-garden-40399.herokuapp.com/expenses).

### /GET at `/expenses/:id`
The `/GET/:id` endpoint can be accessed at `/expenses/:id` on the back-end through the heroku server at [https://fast-garden-40399.herokuapp.com/expenses/:id](https://fast-garden-40399.herokuapp.com/expenses/75).

### /DELETE at `/expenses/:id`
The `/DELETE` endpoint is used to delete specific expenses by id. The user can access the `/DELETE` endpoint through the client by visiting the `/budget` page and selecting the <i>Delete</i> button next to the expense that they would like to delete.  The `/DELETE` endpoint can also be accessed at `/expenses` on the back-end through the heroku server at [https://fast-garden-40399.herokuapp.com/expenses](https://fast-garden-40399.herokuapp.com/expenses).

### /POST at `/expenses`
The user can access the `/POST` endpoint through the client by visiting the `/create` page and filling out the form then selecting the <i>Add Expense</i> button.  The `/POST` endpoint can also be accessed at `/expenses` on the back-end through the heroku server at [https://fast-garden-40399.herokuapp.com/expenses](https://fast-garden-40399.herokuapp.com/expenses).

### /PATCH at `/expenses/:id`
The `/PATCH/:id` is used to update specifc expenses by id and the endpoint can be accessed at `/expenses/:id` on the back-end through the heroku server at [https://fast-garden-40399.herokuapp.com/expenses/:id](https://fast-garden-40399.herokuapp.com/expenses/75).

# 
### Easy Budget's API service consists of data that is stored in a PostgreSQL database
# 

- The database creation scripts can be found at `/migrations`
- The database is initially seeded with data that can be found at `/scripts/seeds`
- Both tables are hosted remotely on <b>ElephantSQL</b> and can be accessed 
[here](postgres://ymzzpjmz:kUdfw2oErRwCaXcuLHqSq0mBimn9DRmm@hanno.db.elephantsql.com:5432/ymzzpjmz)

- The PostgreSQL database consists of two tables 
    - <b>budget_expenses</b> 
    <img src="images/budget_expenses.png" alt="budget_expenses table">

    - <b>expense_type</b> 
    <img src="images/expense_type.png" alt="expense_type table">

    - The tables share the relation of `expense_type(id)/budget_expenses(type_id)` and can be joined with the <b>PostgreSQL</b> query of <br>

````
SELECT budget_expenses.id, name, amount, type, category, date
FROM budget_expenses
INNER JOIN expense_type
ON (budget_expenses.type_id = expense_type.id);
````

## Other features to implement in future versions

[ ] Incorporate the `/PATCH` endpoint into the client.
